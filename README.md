# Predicting-Employee-Attrition
What is Employee Attrition? Employee attrition happens when an employee leaves an organization for any reason and is not replaced for a long time, or not ever. It often results in a decrease in the size of an organization’s or department’s workforce because positions aren’t refilled when employees leave.

Attrition can occur throughout an entire company or just in certain departments or divisions. This typically happens when automation or new technologies replace employees.
